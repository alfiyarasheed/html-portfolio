   <h1>The Best Movies According to Alfiya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>2018</h3>
<p>This movie is based on the true events that took place in Kerala State in August 2018.
     the film is about human courage and everything that’s needed to boost humanity in the toughest times.
      What a fictional film like 2012 does on a larger scale for the sake of entertainment, 2018 does the same with 
      more humanly believable assets and an inspirational narrative. All that The Kerala Story does is spread hatred,
       and here is the true story from Kerala that does only one thing, and that’s spreading positivity. Films like these
        are needed in times like this, when people are buying negativity for free for multiple agendas and getting brainwashed 
        on celluloid.</p>

         <h3>Om Shanti Oshana</h3>
         <p>The story is sweet and innocent. The plot made out of the story is brilliant and credible. 
            The film made out of the plot is charismatic & nonchalant. Debutante Jude Anthany Joseph succeeds,
             in all ways, with this film and when he comes up with his second film.
            It is a story about a carefree girl who falls in love with a farmer. Her obsession is not infatuation but real love,
             which she soon realizes. The film revolves around her daring attempts to be with the man she is so fond of. Nasriya Nazim 
             so marvelously handles the lead role that I am at awe right now. Nivin Pauly is very good, as well. 
            But I am more impressed with the supporting cast. The film moves nicely ahead without boring its audience.</p>
            <h3>Usthad Hotel</h3>
            <p>
